"""
Question Answering Engine — generates answers strictly from retrieved document context.

Core principles:
  1. ONLY use the provided context to answer.
  2. If the answer is not in the context, state that clearly.
  3. Never hallucinate or invent policies.

Supports two backends:
  - Google Gemini (e.g., models/gemini-2.5-flash-lite)
  - OpenAI (e.g., gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o)
